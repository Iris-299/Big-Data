# Compute tree height
> You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance from a leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.  

## Problem Description
* **Input Format**  
  The first line contains the number of nodes 𝑛. The second line contains 𝑛 integer numbers from −1 to 𝑛 − 1 — parents of nodes. If the 𝑖-th one of them (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1) is −1, node 𝑖 is the root, otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of 𝑖-th node. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one root. It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.
* **Constraints**  
  1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10^5.
* **Output Format**  
  Output the height of the tree.
  
## Samples
* Sample 1:  
**Input**:  
&emsp;n = 5  
&emsp;parent = [4, -1, 4, 1, 1]  
**Output**:  
&emsp;3  
**Explanation**:  
&emsp;The input means that there are 5 nodes with numbers from 0 to 4, node 0 is a child of node 4, node 1 is the root, node 2 is a child of node 4, node 3 is a child of node 1 and node 4 is a child of node 1.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;root  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/\  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;3&ensp;4  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;/\  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;0&ensp;2  
* Sample 2:  
**Input**:  
&emsp;n = 5  
&emsp;parent = [-1, 0, 4, 0, 3]  
**Output**:  
&emsp;4  
**Explanation**:  
&emsp;The input means that there are 5 nodes with numbers from 0 to 4, node 0 is the root, node 1 is a child of node 0, node 2 is a child of node 4, node 3 is a child of node 0 and node 4 is a child of node 3.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;root  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/\  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;1&ensp;3  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;|   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;4  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;|   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;2  

## My Solution
```python3
# python3

import sys
import threading

sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 7)  # max depth of recursion
threading.stack_size(2 ** 25)  # new thread will get stack of such size


class TreeHeight:

    def __init__(self):
        self.n = 0
        self.parent = []
        self.cache = []

    def read(self):
        """Reads data from standard input."""
        self.n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        self.parent = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        self.cache = [0] * self.n

    def path_len(self, node_id):
        """Returns path length from given node to the root."""
        parent = self.parent[node_id]
        if parent == -1:
            return 1

        if self.cache[node_id]:
            return self.cache[node_id]

        self.cache[node_id] = 1 + self.path_len(self.parent[node_id])
        return self.cache[node_id]

    def compute_height(self):
        """Computes the tree height."""
        return max([self.path_len(i) for i in range(self.n)])


def main():
    tree = TreeHeight()
    tree.read()
    print(tree.compute_height())


threading.Thread(target=main).start()
